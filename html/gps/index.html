    What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
      To better organize the page and help with accessibility, especially for those with disabilities who are using readers. I think the most useful semantic tags are main and aside. 
    What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
      Parse HTML to construct DOM tree and Parse CSS to construct style rules -> Render Tree Construction -> Layout of Render Tree -> Painting Render Tree
    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
      I learned how to create snippets which will be very handy later to create page templates.
    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
      The most difficult for part of the challenge for me was creating snippets, since I was the most unfamiliar with those.
