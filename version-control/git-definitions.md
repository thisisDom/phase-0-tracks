# Git Definitions
**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.
* What is version control?  Why is it useful?   
    Version control is a way to manage a project in different states during the project's existence. This is useful because if a bug presents itself in the project, it can be reverted to a previous version where the bug didn't exist. It also allows for multiple people to contribute to the project at the same time without having to wait for others to finish with their contributions. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?   
    A branch is a copy of a project that can be worked on and then merged back with the master version of the project, applying any changes made. It would be used when multiple people want to work the same project repository at the same time.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?   
    A commit is save point for a repository that can be revert back to. A good commit message gives details to the changes made to the contents of the repository.ls
* What is a merge conflict?   
    A merge conflict is when two branches merging back to the main branch have conflicting changes. For example, if two branches make edits the same line or if one makes an edit to a line while the other deletes the line all together.
